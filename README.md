wait what should I write here...

remind me to do the following:

* write android apps
* [portal2d](https://github.com/RainbowAsteroids/Portal2D)
* do some cool stuff with [nim](https://nim-lang.org)

## Note:
I just made a [self-hosted gitea](https://gitea.portal2d.xyz) server, so I may 
opt to use that more often than GitHub.
